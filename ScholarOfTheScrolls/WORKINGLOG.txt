5/10 - Close to getting the basic design down. The dual column layout is still an issue. It won't line up correctly.
	Have to review that in the books and also how to do a fixed/liquid hybrid layout. Then its on to creating content.

5/13 - Fixed te column issue. I forgot to account for padding. I now need to create content for the pages. Also get down
       a layout to use for the information. Images should either be centered above content or floated to the right.        Research that.

5/15 - Layouts are set. Now its all filling in content.
