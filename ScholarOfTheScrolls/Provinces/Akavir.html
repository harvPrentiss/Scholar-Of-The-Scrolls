			<h2>Akavir</h2>
			<p>Akavir(Dragon Land) is east of Tamriel and has a history of warring with Tamriel. All of what is known of Akavir comes from the viewpoint
				of Tamriel. There are no records from Akavir itself.</p>
				
			<br/>	
			
			<p>None of the races in Tamriel exist in Akavir. Akavir itself is divided into four seperate nations with each having its own race.</p>
			<h3>Kamal</h3>
			<p>Kamal(Snow Hell) is inhabited by many demons. They freeze during the winter and then thaw out in the summer. During the summer they try to
				invade somewhere. Their favorite target is the Tang Mo another Akaviri nation. In the past the Demon King Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal attempted
				to invade Morrowind, but was defeated.</p>
			<h3>Tsaesci</h3>
			<p>Tsaesci(Snake Palace) is home to Vampire Snake people who have a human upper body and a snake like lower body. The scales on their lower body
				are said to be golden. They use the goblin tribes of Akavir for food and slave labor. At the height of their power they had conquered Tamriel
				and their leader Potente Versidue-Shaie ruled over Tamriel for 400 years until he was assassinated.</p>
			<h3>Tang Mo</h3>
			<p>Tang Mo(Thousand Monkey Isles) is home to many different breeds of monkeys. Other Akaviri nations have tried to enslave them multiple times,
				but during these times the monkeys band together in an army and are almost unbeatable. They are rumored to be allies of the tiger people of
				Ka Po' Tun.</p>
			<h3>Ka Po' Tun</h3>
			<p>Ka Po' Tun(Tiger-Dragon Empire) is ruled by Tosh Raka a tiger dragon. His subjects are cat-like in appearance. They are the strongest empire in
				Akavir and Tosh Raka is the largest dragon in the world. Long ago the Tsaesci tried to eat the dragons and a great battle was fought. In the end
				the snake people of Tsaesci and the cat people of Po' Tun were extremely weakened and the dragons were extinct. Since this time the cat people 
				have tried to become dragons, but only Tosh Raka has been able to do so. It is believed they plan on invading Tamriel, but they don't fight 
				well at sea and this may be holding them back.</p>
